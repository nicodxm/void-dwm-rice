# Void-Linux DWM Rice
Here are just my config files and suckless builds
-------------------
Packages:
- Neovim with plug
- Picom ibhagwan
- LaTex
- Evince
- Firefox
- slock
- dwm
- dmenu
- st
- xss-lock
------------------
To install dwm, st, dmenu and slock you simply need to have build tools and: sudo make clean install
------------------
In my build i don't use any display manager, just startx. DWM is already patched.
